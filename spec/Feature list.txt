# Tarot App — Feature Roadmap (MVP → V1 → V2)

This document defines the feature scope and prioritization for the Tarot App:
- **MVP** proves the core loop end-to-end in a single session (no accounts, no saving, no paywall).
- **V1** productizes the MVP (accounts, persistence, premium gating, credits/payments, chat with context preservation, search, exports, AI over history).
- **V2** adds pro workflows (clients) and daily email digests.

---

## MVP feature list (no accounts, no saving, no paywall)

### 1) Card database (static)
- 78 cards
- Upright + reversed meanings
- Keywords 

### 2) Standard spreads (built-in)
Include these standard spreads:
- **Diamond** (5 cards)
- **Energy Mix** (4 cards)
- **Blockage** (6 cards)
- **Two Paths** (8 cards)

Each spread must have:
- `name`
- `purpose` / `when_to_use`
- `n_cards`
- `positions[]` (meaning of each position)
- `layout_descriptor` (simple grid/string like so X5X\n213\nX4X for diamond)

### 3) Custom spread builder
- Create/edit/delete custom spreads
- Layout editor (simple grid/string)
- positions (assign meaning to each position)
- Validation: `len(positions) == n_cards`

### 4) New reading flow
- Choose spread
- Enter question/topic (free text)
- Choose draw mode:
  - QRNG (default) or slot machine mechanics (described below)
  - Manual entry (optional, but recommended)
  - A session may contain multiple readings. IN MVP, readings persist during a session (no save option)

### 5) RNG system (MVP-critical)
Implement a **cascade** with provenance metadata (even if not persisted yet—store in session state):
1. Primary: **QRNG**
2. Fallback: **random.org**
3. Fallback: **slot-machine click selection** (rapid loop through cards; user clicks to select)

Requirements:
- Ensure uniqueness (no duplicates), unless a user toggles “allow duplicates”
- Record provenance metadata in the active session:
  - `rng_method_used`: `qrng | random_org | slot_machine | manual`
  - `rng_provider` (if applicable)
  - timestamps and any provider request/receipt id if available

### 6) Reading view (non-AI interpretation aid)
- Display layout + drawn cards
- For each position:
  - position meaning
  - card meaning (upright/reversed)
- Notes (in-session only; not persisted in MVP)
- ability to scroll through pas readings in the current session.

### 7) AI interpretation (one-shot)
- Button: “Interpret this spread” → one cohesive output
- Interpretation only for active reading in the session. No interpretation across readings in MVP.

**MVP definition of done**
A user can do a reading end-to-end in one sitting and leave with something meaningful.

## V1 feature list (productization + premium layer)

### 8) User accounts
- Signup / login / logout
- Password reset

### 9) Save + history
- Save sessions (each session may contain multiple readings)
- History: list + open + delete
- (Optional) export/backup

### 10) Premium paywall
- AI features hidden/locked behind premium state
- Upgrade flow messaging (even if payments aren’t wired yet)

### 11) Credits + payments
- Credits balance
- Purchase credits
- Credits ledger (auditable: purchases + spends)

### 12) Chat anchored to readings (context preservation)
- Chat thread per session, may include multiple spreads
- Model context rules:
- interpretation focuses on active spread. Past spreads in a given session will be preserved in context in condensed form. 
  - Active context management: model always sees: 
  - The most recent 20 interactions between the model and the user. 
  - A summary of everything that happened prior to these 20 interactions.
  - The most recent spread laid, and the question it is supposed to answer.
   - A short summary of all previous spreads laid in this session.

### 13) Search & filters (proper)
- Filters: topic, spread, date range
- Full-text search over: question + notes + AI output

### 14) Tags
- Add/edit tags per reading
- Filter by tags

### 15) Filter by card
- Example: “Show readings containing The Tower”

### 16) Card encyclopedia
- Browse/search cards
- Card detail pages

### 17) Export / backup
- Export single reading (image/PDF)
- Export all data (JSON/CSV)
- Import restore (nice-to-have)

### 18) AI across history (topic overview / pattern mining)
- Example: “Summarize my love readings since October”
- Output: recurring cards/themes + turning points
- past sessions can be called into context by the model or the user if appropriate 

### 19) Quality + safety
- Rate limiting / abuse guardrails
- Disclaimers

---

## V2
- **Client support** (profiles + history per client + pro workflow)
- **Daily emails** (topic-based draw + interpretation + digest)

---

## Guardrails (implementation notes)
- Even in MVP, design internal objects as if V1 persistence exists:
  - `Reading`, `Spread`, `CardDraw`, `RngProvenance`, `AiInterpretationResult`
  This makes V1 persistence mostly “save these objects”.

- Put QRNG/random.org behind a backend service even in MVP if possible to avoid CORS/rate-limit issues and to standardize fallback logic.
